# selenium-WebDriverConcepts

Hi!

This project helps in understanding the basics of selenium webdriver. Scripts are written in Java.

Each Test case is used to understand various concepts like Alerts, MouseOver, Javascript Executors etc., involved in automating test cases.

In order to run the scripts for Application Under Test (AUT), it is required to have the executable file(confidential) 
of the application which will help the application to run on the localhost.

In places where there was a need for entering a URL to open the application, you'll find it as "Enter URL".

The sole aim of this repo is to help grasp the concepts of automation testing with java.
